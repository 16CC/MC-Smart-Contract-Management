# Assessment Contract

This Solidity program is a simple smart contract that demonstrates the basic syntax and functionality of the Solidity programming language. The purpose of this program is to serve as a starting point for those who are new to Solidity and want to understand how smart contracts can handle balance management on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Description

This program is a smart contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract has three main functions:

- `getBalance`: Returns the current balance of the contract.
- `deposit`: Allows users to send Ether to the contract, increasing its balance.
- `withdraw`: Allows users to withdraw a specified amount of Ether from the contract, decreasing its balance.

This program serves as a simple and straightforward introduction to Solidity programming, demonstrating basic concepts like state variables, payable functions, and Ether transfers. It can be used as a stepping stone for more complex projects in the future.
